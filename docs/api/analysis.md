The analysis functionality is distributed across several modules:

- `vrAnalysis.syd`: Analysis tools for place cells, reliability, and plasticity
- `vrAnalysis.analysis.same_cell_candidates`: Tools for identifying same cell candidates
- `vrAnalysis.analysis.tracked_plasticity`: Analysis of tracked cell plasticity

Note: The `vrAnalysis.analysis` package is not directly importable as a module. Refer to individual submodules for specific functionality.
