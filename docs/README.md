# vrAnalysis Documentation
Hi, you found the documentation folder of vrAnalysis. This is super 
light-weight documentation that's primary purpose is to remind myself what I
have written so I don't forget. It's got a list of common use-cases for the 
code, so should be very easy to help either myself or a new user. 

Note: Almost all of this code was developed and used in jupyter lab on a 
windows 10 machine. Sometimes I also used visual studio to run my notebooks. 
Therefore, I cannot guarantee that any of it will be work on different setups. 
That being said, if you are not me (or are me in the future) and think this
code would be useful but it (1) isn't working for you, (2) isn't clear how to 
use, or (3) is almost useful but requires small modifications, I'd be happy to
help you get it working.
