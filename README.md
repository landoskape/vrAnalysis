# vrAnalysis
Tools for processing and analyzing data from behavior and imaging experiments,
mostly based on the [vrControl](https://github.com/landoskape/vrControl) 
package. It contains code for:

- Managing a database (in conjunction with microsoft access but can work with
  any SQL database with a few adjustments). 
- Registering and preprocessing experimental data including behavior, imaging,
  and potentially facecam data (not coded yet). 
- Manually annotating results, especially related to whether cells are 
  expressing a counter-fluorophore and for annotating tracked ROIs (not coded
  yet). 
- Analyzing data using organized analysis objects that make it easy to do an
  analysis across groups of sessions from the database).
